Results — Perceptual Verification (Across 2020–2024)

Perceptual damping (ε, λ=0.5, γ=1.0).
Across 2020–2024, FI(ε) exhibits a monotonic decrease and reaches a plateau around ε≈0.20–0.30. We therefore define a damping stability band in this range and fix ε*=0.20 as a representative operating point. CV(Δv) remains nearly constant and serves as a secondary check for smoothness.

Viscosity (λ, ε=0.20, γ=1.0).
For each year, RC(λ)—the boundary/interior dwell-time ratio defined via ρ-quantiles (q0.80 vs q0.50)—increases with λ and reveals a viscous critical band where the two-step rule (consecutive RC≥2.0) is satisfied. In 2021, this criterion is met at λ≈0.66–0.67, yielding λ≈0.67. Other years did not reach τ=2.0 within the scanned range (λ≤0.70), and are thus retained as ε-only calibration references. Their λ-related fields are intentionally left blank to avoid artificial interpolation.

Phase & timeline evidence.
Phase diagrams (ε×λ→FI/RC) consistently show FI decreasing with ε and a narrow RC band near λ*. Timeline excerpts at (γ=1.0, ε=0.20, λ≈λ*) exhibit respiratory smoothness and boundary dwell-time amplification, visually corroborating the quantitative criteria.

Proxy→Measured replacement.
The above computations use the proxy Δt′ from dt_target. Once dt_applied becomes available, the same pipeline will be rerun for direct measurement, targeting r(\hat d,Δt_applied)≥0.80 and MAPE(Δt_target,Δt_applied)≤10%.

Damping sweep (ε, λ=0.5, γ=1.0).
FI declines with ε in all available years — 2020: 0.243→0.376, 2021: 0.288→0.410, 2022: 0.262→0.391, 2023: 0.258→0.399, 2024: 0.241→0.367.
We fix ε=0.20* as the representative operating point across years.

Viscosity sweep (λ, ε=0.20, γ=1.0).
2020: no two-step (max RC=1.000 @ λ=0.40);
2021: λ*≈0.67 (band 0.66–0.67);
2022–2024: no two-step (max RC=1.000 @ λ=0.40).

Note. Status by year — 2020: measured (dt_applied); 2021–2024: proxy (dt_target).
Across 2020–2024, ε* remains stable within 0.20–0.25, while λ* shows a potential upward drift from ≈0.65 to ≈0.70 (based on proxy estimates), suggesting an increasing viscosity of the perceptual field.
